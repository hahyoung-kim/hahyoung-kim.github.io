                Reading Response: <br>
                After reading the essay, "As We May Think", I found it to be interesting <br>
                because even though the essay was written in 1945, the author had made <br>
                several accurate predictions regarding future technology. The author <br>
                had predicted a device called a memex that would allow users to store <br>
                their information and use for communication. This device is similar to <br>
                computers, smartphones, and tablet pcs in the modern world. <br>
