                Reading Response: <br>
                After reading the essay, "As We May Think", I found it to be interesting 
                because even though the essay was written in 1945, the author had made 
                several accurate predictions regarding future technology. The author 
                had predicted a device called a memex that would allow users to store 
                their information and use for communication. This device is similar to 
                computers, smartphones, and tablet pcs in the modern world.
