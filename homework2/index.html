                    This quote caught my attention because, with the invention of a camera,<br>
                    it allowed paintings and images to be transmittable as opposed to one <br>
                    coming to view them in person. Thus, allowing paintings to hold various <br>
                    meanings and interpretations for which reproductions allowed these images <br>
                    to be viewed anywhere. An aspect of the videos that I had found interesting <br>
                    is when John Berger outlines the various ways paintings can be distorted. <br>
                    For example, a camera simply zooming in on an image can change the focus <br>
                    to a single area, whereas in a whole painting, everything is happening <br>
                    simultaneously. Another method of distortion Berger mentions is the impact <br>
                    of music and rhythm for which it affects the overall mood of one viewing <br>
                    the painting. Therefore, allowing various interpretations and meanings to <br>
                    be formed while losing the unique meanings paintings once held <br>
